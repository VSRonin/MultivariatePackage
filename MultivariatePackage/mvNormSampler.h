//! Multivariate Normal Distribution
/*!
\details This class provides the functionality of calculating the probability density value and generate random samples from a multivariate normal.

It uses the [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) libraries for linear algebra computation and [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) libraries for statistical distribution and random number generation.

The analytical process is based upon the [mvtnorm package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mvtnorm/index.html) for [R](http://www.r-project.org/) by Alan Genz, Frank Bretz, Tetsuhisa Miwa, Xuefei Mi, Friedrich Leisch, Fabian Scheipl, Bjoern Bornkamp, Torsten Hothorn

To generate samples a [boost::random::mt19937](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/doc/html/boost/random/mt19937.html) random number generator is used and seeded with [std::time(NULL)](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ctime/time/).<br>
If you construct multiple instances of this class, to avoid the generated samples to be the same you should supply a different seed. To do so, for example, you can call `MyDistribution.SetRandomSeed(MyDistribution.GetCurrentSeed()+1U);`

Example Usage:<br>
Create a bivariate normal with mean \f$ \begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
0
\end{bmatrix}
\f$ and variance-covariance matrix \f$ \begin{bmatrix}
3 & 1 \\
1 & 3
\end{bmatrix}
\f$:

\code
std::vector<double> MeanVector;
MeanVector.push_back(1.0);
MeanVector.push_back(0.0);
std::vector<double> VarMatrix(4);
VarMatrix[0]=3;
VarMatrix[1]=1;
VarMatrix[2]=1;
VarMatrix[3]=3;
mvNormSampler BivNorm(2); //A Bivariate standard normal 
BivNorm.SetMeanVector(MeanVector); //Set the Mean Vector
BivNorm.SetVarCovMatrix(VarMatrix); //Set the Var-Cov Matrix
\endcode

Calculate the density of the distribution corresponding to the values \f$ \begin{bmatrix} 
0.5 \\
-0.3
\end{bmatrix}
\f$ and print it to the console:

\code
std::vector<double> Values;
Values.push_back(0.5);
Values.push_back(-0.3);
double densityValue=BivNorm.GetDensity(Values);
cout << endl << "Desity for [0.5;-0.3]: " << densityValue;
\endcode

Generate 1000 random samples from this distribution and print them to the console

\code
std::map<unsigned int,std::vector<double> > Samples=BivNorm.ExtractSamples(1000);
cout << "Var 1\tVar2";
for(int j=0;j<1000;j++){
	cout << endl;
	for(unsigned int i=0;i<BivNorm.GetDimension();i++){
		cout << Samples.at(i).at(j) << '\t'
	}
}
\endcode
